We can start with some science fiction. Here on Earth, I enter
the Teletransporter. When I press some button, a machine
destroys my body, while recording the exact states of all my
cells. The information is sent by radio to Mars, where another
machine makes, out of organic materials, a perfect copy of
my body. The person who wakes up on Mars seems to re-
member living my life up to the moment when I pressed the
button, and he is in every other way just like me.
Of those who have thought about such cases, some believe
that it would be I who would wake up on Mars. They regard
Teletransportation as merely the fastest way of travelling.
Others believe that, if I chose to be Teletransported, I would
be making a terrible mistake. On their view, the person who
wakes up would be a mere Replica of me.

That is a disagreement about personal identity. To under-
stand such disagreements, we must distinguish two kinds of
sameness. Two white billiard balls may be qualitatively iden-
tical, or exactly similar. But they are not numerically identical, or one and the same ball. If I paint one of these balls red,
it will cease to be qualitatively identical with itself as it was;
but it will still be one and the same ball. Consider next a claim
like, 'Since her accident, she is no longer the same person'.
That involves both senses of identity. It means that she, one
and the same person, is not now the same person. That is not
a contradiction. The claim is only that this person's character
has changed. This numerically identical person is now quali-
tatively different.
When psychologists discuss identity, they are typically con-
cerned with the kind of person someone is, or wants to be.
That is the question involved, for example, in an identity
crisis. But, when philosophers discuss identity, it is numerical
identity they mean. And, in our concern about our own fu-
tures, that is what we have in mind. I may believe that, after
my marriage, I shall be a different person. But that does not
make marriage death. However much I change, I shall still be
alive if there will be someone living who will be me. Similarly,
if I was Teletransported, my Replica on Mars would be
qualitatively identical to me; but, on the sceptic's view, he
wouldn't be me. I shall have ceased to exist. And that, we
naturally assume, is what matters.
Questions about our numerical identity all take the follow-
ing form. We have two ways of referring to a person, and we
ask whether these are ways of referring to the same person.
Thus we might ask whether Boris Nikolayevich is Yeltsin. In
the most important questions of this kind, our two ways of
referring to a person pick out a person at different times.
Thus we might ask whether the person to whom we are
speaking now is the same as the person to whom we spoke on
the telephone yesterday. These are questions about identity
over time.
To answer such questions, we must know the criterion of
personal identity: the relation between a person at one time,
and a person at another time, which makes these one and the
same person.
Different criteria have been advanced. On one view, what
makes me the same, throughout my life, is my having the same body. This criterion requires uninterrupted bodily con-
tinuity. There is no such continuity between my body on
Earth and the body of my Replica on Mars; so, on this view,
my Replica would not be me. Other writers appeal to psycho-
logical continuity. Thus Locke claimed that, if I was con-
scious of a past life in some other body, I would be the person
who lived that life. On some versions of this view, my Replica
would be me.
Supporters of these different views often appeal to cases
where they conflict. Most of these cases are, like
Teletransportation, purely imaginary. Some philosophers
object that, since our concept of a person rests on a scaffold-
ing of facts, we should not expect this concept to apply in
imagined cases where we think those facts away. I agree. But
I believe that, for a different reason, it is worth considering
such cases. We can use them to discover, not what the truth is,
but what we believe. We might have found that, when we
consider science fiction cases, we simply shrug our shoulders.
But that is not so. Many of us find that we have certain beliefs
about what kind of fact personal identity is.
These beliefs are best revealed when we think about
such cases from a first-person point of view. So, when I imag-
ine something's happening to me, you should imagine its
happening to you. Suppose that I live in some future century,
in which technology is far advanced, and I am about to
undergo some operation. Perhaps my brain and body will be
remodelled, or partially replaced. There will be a resulting
person, who will wake up tomorrow. I ask, 'Will that person
be me? Or am I about to die? Is this the end?' I may not
know how to answer this question. But it is natural to assume
that there must be an answer. The resulting person, it may
seem, must be either me, or someone else. And the answer
must be all-or-nothing. That person cannot be partly me. If
that person is in pain tomorrow, this pain cannot be partly
mine. So, we may assume, either I shall feel that pain, or I
shan't.
If this is how we think about such cases, we assume that our
identity must be determinate. We assume that, in every imaginable case, questions about our identity must have an-
swers, which must be either, and quite simply, Yes or No.
Let us now ask: 'Can this be true?' There is one view
on which it might be. On this view, there are immaterial
substances: souls, or Cartesian Egos. These entities have
the special properties once ascribed to atoms: they are
indivisible, and their continued existence is, in its nature,
all or nothing. And such an Ego is what each of us really
is.
Unlike several writers, I believe that such a view might
have been true. But we have no good evidence for thinking
that it is, and some evidence for thinking that it isn't; so I shall
assume here that no such view is true.
If we do not believe that there are Cartesian Egos, or other
such entities, we should accept the kind of view which I have
elsewhere called Reductionist. On this view
(I) A person's existence just consists in the existence of a
body, and the occurrence of a series of thoughts, ex-
periences, and other mental and physical events.
Some Reductionists claim
(2) Persons just are bodies.
This view may seem not to be Reductionist, since it does not
reduce persons to something else. But that is only because it
is hyper-Reductionist: it reduces persons to bodies in so
strong a way that it doesn't even distinguish between them.
We can call it Identifying Reductionism.
Such a view seems to me too simple. I believe that we
should combine (I) with
(3) A person is an entity that has a body, and has thoughts
and other experiences.
On this view, though a person is distinct from that person's
body, and from any series of thoughts and experiences, the
person's existence just consists in them. So we can call this
view Constitutive Reductionism.
It may help to have other examples of this kind of view. If
we melt down a bronze statue, we destroy this statue, but we
do not destroy this lump of bronze. So, though the statue just
consists in the lump of bronze, these cannot be one and the
same thing. Similarly, the existence of a nation just consists in
the existence of a group of people, on some territory, living
together in certain ways. But the nation is not the same as
that group of people, or that territory.
Consider next Eliminative Reductionism. Such a view is
sometimes a response to arguments against the Identifying
view. Suppose we start by claiming that a nation just is a
group of people on some territory. Weare then persuaded
that this cannot be so: that the concept of a nation is the
concept of an entity that is distinct from its people and its
territory. We may conclude that, in that case, there are really
no such things as nations. There are only groups of people,
living together in certain ways.
In the case of persons, some Buddhist texts take an Elim-
inative view. According to these texts
(4) There really aren't such things as persons: there
are only brains and bodies, and thoughts and other
experiences.
For example:
Buddha has spoken thus: '0 brethren, actions do exist, and also
their consequences, but the person that acts does not. ... There
exists no Individual, it is only a conventional name given to a set of
elements.'
Or:
The mental and the material are really here,
But here there is no person to be found.
For it is void and merely fashioned like a doll,
Just suffering piled up like grass and sticks.
Eliminative Reductionism is sometimes justified. Thus we are
right to claim that there were really no witches, only per-
secuted women. But Reductionism about some kind of entityDerek Parfit
is not often well expressed with the claim that there are no
such entities. We should admit that there are nations, and
that we, who are persons, exist.
Rather than claiming that there are no entities of some
kind, Reductionists should distinguish kinds of entity, or
ways of existing. When the existence of an X just consists
in the existence of a Y, or Ys, though the X is distinct
from the Y or Ys, it is not an independent or separately
existing entity. Statues do not exist separately from the
matter of which they are made. Nor do nations exist
separately from their citizens and their territory. Similarly, I
believe,
(5) Though persons are distinct from their bodies, and
from any series of mental events, they are not inde-
pendent or separately existing entities.
Cartesian Egos, if they existed, would not only be distinct
from human bodies, but would also be independent entities.
Such Egos are claimed to be like physical objects, except that
they are wholly mental. If there were such entities, it would
make sense to suppose that they might cease to be causally
related to some body, yet continue to exist. But, on a
Reductionist view, persons are not in that sense independent
from their bodies. (That is not to claim that our thoughts and
other experiences are merely changes in the states of our
brains. Reductionists, while not believing in purely mental
substances, may be dualists.)
We can now return to personal identity over time, or what
constitutes the continued existence of the same person. One
question here is this. What explains the unity of a person's
mental life? What makes thoughts and experiences, had at
different times, the thoughts and experiences of a single per-
son? According to some Non-Reductionists, this question
cannot be answered in other terms. We must simply claim
that these different thoughts and experiences are all had by
the same person. This fact does not consist in any other facts,
but is a bare or ultimate truth.
If each of us was a Cartesian Ego, that might be so. Since
such an Ego would be an independent substance, it could be
an irreducible fact that different experiences are all changes
in the states of the same persisting Ego. But that could not be
true of persons, I believe, if, while distinct from their bodies,
they are not separately existing entities. A person, so con-
ceived, is not the kind of entity about which there could be
such irreducible truths. When experiences at different times
are all had by the same person, this fact must consist in
certain other facts.
If we do not believe in Cartesian Egos, we should claim
(6) Personal identity over time just consists in physical
andlor psychological continuity.
That claim could be filled out in different ways. On one
version of this view, what makes different experiences the
experiences of a single person is their being either changes in
the states of, or at least directly causally related to, the same
embodied brain. That must be the view of those who believe
that persons just are bodies. And we might hold that view
even if, as I think we should, we distinguish persons from
their bodies. But we might appeal, either in addition or in-
stead, to various psychological relations between different
mental states and events, such as the relations involved in
memory, or in the persistence of intentions, desires, and
other psychological features. That is what I mean by psycho-
logical continuity.
On Constitutive Reductionism, the fact of personal ident-
ity is distinct from these facts about physical and psychologi-
cal continuity. But, since it just consists in them, it is not an
independent or separately obtaining fact. It is not a further
difference in what happens.
To illustrate that distinction, consider a simpler case. Sup-
pose that I already know that several trees are growing
together on some hill. I then learn that, because that is true,
there is a copse on this hill. That would not be new factual
information. I would have merely learnt that such a group of trees can be called a 'copse'. My only new information is
about our language. That those trees can be called a copse is
not, except trivially, a fact about the trees.
Something similar is true in the more complicated case of
nations. In order to know the facts about the history of a
nation, it is enough to know what large numbers of people did
and said. Facts about nations cannot be barely true: they must
consist in facts about people. And, once we know these other
facts, any remaining questions about nations are not further
questions about what really happened.
I believe that, in the same way, facts about people cannot
be barely true. Their truth must consist in the truth of facts
about bodies, and about various interrelated mental and
physical events. If we knew these other facts, we would have
all the empirical input that we need. If we understood the
concept of a person, and had no false beliefs about what
persons are, we would then know, or would be able to work
out, the truth of any further claims about the existence or
identity of persons. That is because such claims would not tell
us more about reality.
That is the barest sketch of a Reductionist view. These
remarks may become clearer if we return to the so-called
'problem cases' of personal identity. In such a case, we im-
agine knowing that, between me now and some person in the
future, there will be certain kinds or degrees of physical and/
or psychological continuity or connectedness. But, though we
know these facts, we cannot answer the question whether
that future person would be me.
Since we may disagree on which the problem cases are, we
need more than one example. Consider first the range of
cases that I have elsewhere called the Physical Spectrum. In
each of these cases, some proportion of my body would be
replaced, in a single operation, with exact duplicates of the
existing cells. In the case at the near end of this range, no cells
would be replaced. In the case at the far end, my whole body
would be destroyed and replicated. That is the case with
which I began: Teletransportation.
